    <p>Please briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences. (300 words)

Sitting in front of the wall-length mirror in the sunlit studio, I studied the contours of my face. My eyebrows drew together and the crinkle near my eyes reappeared as I frowned. Despite weeks of Abhinaya practice in front of the mirror, the camera, and even my pillow Crabby, I struggled to express loneliness. Bharatanatyam, a dance I began to learn at only 8 years old, was inherently difficult to perfect. While my hand gestures and intricate movements could tell stories, only my face could convey narratives. It was only after watching a recording of a past performance that I realized I imitated the shapes in the mirror rather than expressing the emotion itself. As my appreciation for the dance’s evocative stories grew, I realized Bharatanatyam is different.
My realization developed as I performed at local culture fairs and events and taught younger students, helping choreograph dances and encouraging them to embrace the art of storytelling. With each step, each expression and each ring of the bells on my feet, Bharatanatyam became a mode of communication for me to connect with others. The hours spent memorizing the choreography until just hearing the music could spur me into a dance culminated in ways I could share its detailed stories with diverse audiences. I performed a fusion of classic fairytales, such as Cinderella, at a local library for elementary school children. I used my knowledge of emotional expressions as I interviewed veterans suffering from PTSD for the Army Heritage Center. At RPI, I will continue promoting cultural diffusion as I storytell with the Rudras at the annual Diwali Show and explore interdisciplinary projects at the EMPAC. Although Bharatanatyam is different, it is a difference that reunites me with my heritage, offers new opportunities each day and supports my love for people-watching.

When I watched Alan Turing break the Enigma Code in The Imitation Game, I was completely unaware of the actual game - the Turing Test. The test explores the possibility of mistaking AI for humans, something unfathomable until I learned about Eugene Goostman, a chatbot that fooled researchers by posing as a Ukrainian boy. The enigmatic Turing Test piqued my interest in the boundary between humans and technology, leading me to recognize the significance of ethical technology and coexistence with artificial systems as partners.

As a tech changemaker, I can further the applications of natural language processing in educational and community settings such that it can benefit a diverse population. Through Rensselaer’s artificial intelligence research collaborations with professionals at IBM and the multidisciplinary applications of technology at the Cognitive and Immersive Systems Lab, I will be able to continue my exploration and research of language models and word classification under Professor Tomek Strzalkowski. While collaborating with professors and graduate students on the Immersive Language Learning Environment, I will not only expand Rensselaer’s Mandarin project to include applications that support disabled students but also my goal of supporting diversity in technology due to the unparalleled support for undergraduate research opportunities.

Apart from my quest to crack the Enigma code, Rensselaer offers a connection to local and worldwide communities as I build a sisterhood with the Association of Computing Machinery Women’s Chapter and implement initiatives such as participant aid at HackRPI to help others “code the world”. My experience at Rensselaer will not only be about breaking barriers but also about building connections as I seek to turn the Turing Test into a thrilling game of my own.
